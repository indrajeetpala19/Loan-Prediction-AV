Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. 
These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. 
To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they 
can specifically target these customers. 
The current approach uses Random Forest model to achieve an accuracy of around 78%.
However, by eliminating certain outliers and applying XGBoost or a similar boosting algorithm, the accuracy can be increased.
